The above link has a fairly in-depth example of how to build a simple logging function as need be.

The keys are set at the bottom of the redis file. There are comment blocks in the config file as such:
#========================================================================================
#========================================================================================
#========================================================================================

Which dictates what was changed from the original file by me below the block. The rest is auto-generated as need be.
